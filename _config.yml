With a passion for solving complex problems and advancing science, I bring extensive experience at the intersection of biomedical engineering, data analytics, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Over my career, I have:<br>
Designed and implemented innovative systems like a forced oscillation measurement system for ARDS research, which has advanced to clinical trials in ICU settings. <br>
Managed over 25 projects, trained 15+ researchers, and contributed to securing approximately $15 million in NIH funding.<br>
Published multiple peer-reviewed articles and fostered collaborations with Key Opinion Leaders, CROs, and multidisciplinary teams.<br>
My expertise spans lung mechanics, oncology, physiology, and pathology, with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, data visualization and machine learning.<br>
Whether it's developing custom research equipment, analyzing tumor environments through advanced imaging, or optimizing clinical trial systems, I strive to deliver impactful results.
